# SearchWP

![Logo](/src/chrome/skin/classic/icon.png?raw=true) SearchWP is an add-on for Mozilla Firefox. It converts your search box into a dynamic tool that helps you find what you're searching for quickly and easily. Either reveal the text you were looking for with colour-coded highlighting, or just click on individual words to jump to them.
