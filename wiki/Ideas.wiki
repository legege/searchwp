#summary A list of potential features and improvements

Your feedback is important to me. I'll try to add new features regularly as time permits.

= New features =
 * Enable making a word list not to mark or display (like in, the, at, a)
 * Integrate with the quicksearch (search as you type from the searchbox)

 * Make it possible to find words "loosely", kind of like Google does? For instance, "test-search" would be able to find "test-search", "test search", "testsearch", and so on in the page.

 * Instead of having the search terms be repeated in the chrome as buttons, it would make more sense (both aesthetically and usability-wise) if the actual search text turn into buttons whenever a search was performed. Clicking on those buttons would behave as expected, whereas editing mode would be activated by clicking in-between the buttons, clicking before the list of terms, or after them. The buttons would be transformed back to standard text in this situation. Of course, Ctrl+K would also work. Alt+click could also be a good way to avoid the buttons (just like highlighting linked text).

 * Audible alert in addition to highlighting the word.

= Improvements =

 * Highlighting is too slow. Implement a faster algorithm
 * Some words are missed when highlighting: "my test phrase" in <b>my</b> <b>test</b> <b>phrase</b>

= Suggested, but not directly related to SearchWP =
 * Keep search history in Chronological order and retain it between searches
